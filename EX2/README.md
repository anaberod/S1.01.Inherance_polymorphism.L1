📄 Description - Exercise Statement
This exercise involves creating a Java class called Car with the following attributes:

brand → static final

model → static

power → final

The goal is to demonstrate the differences between these modifiers. Which attributes can be initialized in the constructor? How do static and final attributes behave?

Additionally, the class must include two methods:

A static method called brake() that prints:
"The vehicle is braking"

A non-static method called accelerate() that prints:
"The vehicle is accelerating"

The exercise also requires demonstrating how to call both the static and non-static methods from the main() method in the main class.

💻 Technologies Used

Java 17 or later

Any Java-compatible IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

📋 Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

IDE or terminal for compiling and executing Java code

Basic understanding of Java OOP concepts, especially static vs. instance members

🛠️ Installation

Clone the repository (optional):

bash

git clone https://github.com/anaberod/S1.01.Inherance_polymorphism.L1/tree/209d11bd088a1dabda83f5aa2075c62c8e52a2c6/EX2

Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

Make sure the correct JDK is set up for the project.

▶️ Execution

Compile the program:

bash

javac Main.java
Run the main class:

bash

java Main

You should see console output demonstrating the brake() and accelerate() methods, and the behavior of the class attributes.

🌐 Deployment

This is a standalone Java application intended for learning purposes. No deployment is needed. If desired, package the code into a .jar file:

bash
Copiar
Editar
jar cfe CarExample.jar Main *.class
